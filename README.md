### FuelCheck

FuelCheck provides real-time information about fuel prices at service stations across NSW and is accessible on any device connected to the internet, including smartphones, tablets, desk top computers and laptops. FuelCheck uses information from cellular, 
Wi-Fi, and Global Positioning System (GPS) networks to determine your approximate location.
FuelCheck enables NSW motorists to:
find the cheapest fuel being sold anywhere in NSW
get directions to any service station in NSW
search for fuel by type (E10, Regular, LPG, etc) or brand
submit a complaint to NSW Fair Trading if the price at the pump doesnâ€™t match what is shown on FuelCheck.
